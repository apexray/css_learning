    <h3>Plot of the anime :</h3>
    <p>
      A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf
      village in the Land of Fire, one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries in
      the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth Hokage,
      Minato Namikaze, at the cost of his life, seals the fox inside the body of
      his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, making him a host of the beast.[i] The
      Third Hokage returns from retirement to become the leader of Konoha again.
      Naruto is often scorned by Konoha's villagers for being the host of the
      Nine-Tails. Due to a decree by the Third Hokage forbidding any mention of
      these events, Naruto learns nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years
      later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to him. Naruto
      defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the respect of his teacher, Iruka
      Umino.[ii] Shortly afterward, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with Sasuke
      Uchiha, against whom he often competes, and Sakura Haruno, on whom he has
      a crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced sensei, the elite ninja
      Kakashi Hatake. Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7
      completes missions requested by the villagers, ranging from doing chores
      and being bodyguards to performing assassinations. After several missions,
      including a major one in the Land of Waves, Kakashi allows Team 7 to take
      a ninja exam, enabling them to advance to a higher rank and take on more
      difficult missions, known as Chunin Exams. During the exams, Orochimaru, a
      wanted criminal, invades Konoha and kills the Third Hokage for revenge.
      Jiraiya, one of the three legendary ninjas, declines the title of Fifth
      Hokage and searches with Naruto for Tsunade whom he chooses to become
      Fifth Hokage instead. During the search, it is revealed that Orochimaru
      wishes to train Sasuke because of his powerful genetic heritage, the
      Sharingan.[iii] After Sasuke attempts and fails to kill his older brother
      Itachi,[iv] who had showed up in Konoha to kidnap Naruto, he joins
      Orochimaru, hoping to gain from him the strength needed to kill Itachi.
      The story takes a turn when Sasuke leaves the village: Tsunade sends a
      group of ninja, including Naruto, to retrieve Sasuke, but Naruto is unable
      to persuade or force him to come back. Naruto and Sakura do not give up on
      Sasuke; Naruto leaves Konoha to receive training from Jiraiya to prepare
      himself for the next time he encounters Sasuke, while Sakura becomes
      Tsunade's apprentice.

    <h3>Plot of the anime :</h3>
    <p>
      The story follows Ken Kaneki, a student who barely survives a deadly
      encounter with Rize Kamishiro, his date who reveals herself as a ghoul and
      tries to eat him. He is taken to the hospital in critical condition. After
      recovering, Kaneki discovers that he underwent a surgery that transformed
      him into a half-ghoul. This was accomplished because some of Rize's organs
      were transferred into his body, and now, like normal ghouls, he must
      consume human flesh to survive. Ghouls who run a coffee shop called
      "Anteiku" (あんていく) take him in and teach him to deal with his new life
      as a half-ghoul. Some of his daily struggles include fitting into the
      ghoul society, as well as keeping his identity hidden from his human
      companions, especially from his best friend, Hideyoshi Nagachika. The
      prequel series Tokyo Ghoul [Jack] follows the youths of Kishō Arima and
      Taishi Fura, two characters from the main series who become acquainted
      when they join forces to investigate the death of Taishi's friend at the
      hands of a ghoul, leading to Taishi eventually following Arima's path and
      joining the CCG (Commission of Counter Ghoul), the federal agency tasked
      into dealing with crimes related to ghouls as well. The sequel series
      Tokyo Ghoul:re follows an amnesiac Kaneki under the new identity of Haise
      Sasaki (the result of horrific brain damage sustained from Kishō Arima).
      He is the mentor of a special team of CCG investigators called "Quinx
      Squad" that underwent a similar procedure as his, allowing them to obtain
      the special abilities of Ghouls in order to fight them but still being
      able to live as normal humans.

    <h3>Plot of the anime :</h3>
    <p>
      On a supercontinent version of Earth that has four Moons, powerful
      monsters and supervillains wreak havoc. The millionaire Agoni creates the
      Hero Association, which employs superheroes to fight evil. Saitama, an
      unassociated hero, hails from City Z and performs heroic deeds as a hobby.
      For three years, he has trained enough to defeat any enemy with a single
      punch, his unmatched strength leaving him bored. He becomes a reluctant
      mentor to Genos, a cyborg seeking revenge against another cyborg who
      killed his family and destroyed his hometown, after Saitama defeats a
      monster that defeated Genos. Saitama and Genos join the Hero Association,
      hoping to attain notability, but Genos instantly obtains an S-Class rank;
      meanwhile, due to scoring low on the written exam despite having a perfect
      score on the physical exam, Saitama only becomes a C-Class hero. His feats
      remain unnoticed even after saving people from an asteroid and then a sea
      monster, barely getting himself promoted to B-Class. Later, shortly before
      her death, the seer Shibabawa predicts that the world is in great danger
      as the alien Boros invades the planet. The heroes kill the invaders and
      destroy Boros's ship as Saitama defeats Boros in single combat. Monsters
      begin appearing faster while the rogue martial artist Garo, a former
      apprentice of the hero Bang, and self-dubbed "Hero Hunter," begins
      terrorizing heroes. Due to childhood bullying, he holds a grudge against
      everything "heroic." The heroes learn that the monster influx comes from
      the Monster Association, an organization of monsters under City Z intent
      on destroying the Hero Association. They attack various cities, recruit
      fighters by offering them "monster cells" that mutate humans into
      monsters, and kidnap a Hero Association executive's son. Garo bonds with
      Tareo, a child who idolizes heroes, as he hunts down more heroes, his
      combat prowess slowly rising. The Monster Association attempts to recruit
      him and kidnaps the child when Garo refuses. He storms the Monster
      Association HQ trying to rescue the child but ultimately gets captured.
      The Hero Association assaults the headquarters to rescue the two children,
      causing a battle that destroys City Z and kills almost every monster.
      Saitama meets the highest-ranked hero Blast during the raid when he
      arrives to collect artifacts, who warns him of a threat known as "God."
      Many heroes are heavily injured when Garo emerges, mutated into a monster
      from the fighting. Unable to match the power of Saitama, Garo receives
      some of "God's" power when he meets it in a vision, causing him to emit
      radiation that kills all the heroes, including Genos by ripping out his
      core to get Saitama to fight him seriously. He briefly matches Saitama in
      a brutal battle that sends them across the Solar System. After Saitama
      defeats him, Garo becomes distraught over Tareo's death and teaches
      Saitama to time travel before "God" kills him. Saitama goes back in time
      and subdues Garo before he killed the heroes, destroying his monster
      mutation and cosmic power. Despite the objections of the other heroes,
      Saitama spares Garo and lets him flee after Tareo stops them. Only Genos,
      who reconnected with his core from the original timeline bought by Saitama
      (who seemed to remember nothing of his battle and time travel with the
      original Garo), remembers the entire events of the original ominous future
      caused by Garo. With the Monster Association destroyed, Saitama gets
      promoted to A-Class for defeating Garo. As the battle destroyed his
      apartment, he relocates to the Hero Association's HQ in A-City. The Hero
      Association's poor performance causes public opinion of them to plummet.
      Several heroes and officials decide to retire or defect to the Neo Heroes,
      a rival group appearing to be more effective in handling the growing
      monster threats. Leading it is the hero Blue, who claims to be the son of
      Blast.
